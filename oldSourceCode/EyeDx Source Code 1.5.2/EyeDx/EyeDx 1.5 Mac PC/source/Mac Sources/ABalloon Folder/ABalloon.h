Walker <mailto:jwwalker@kagi.com>		Creation date: 2/26/98		Last Modified: 10/25/98		Purpose:	To assign help balloons to panes in a PowerPlant				window.  You can use different messages depending				on whether the item is on or off, enabled or disabled.					Usage:		Attach an ABalloon to each pane (usually a control)				for which you want to provide balloon help.				Specify a STR# ID and a string index for each state.				And remember to register ABalloon at startup.				You must compile with RTTI for proper function.				If you want a balloon to pop up automatically when				the mouse is motionless over a pane for a certain time,				you must call EnableAutoPop.		Overriding:	The most likely methods to override are ComputeTip				(to provide more appropriate placement of the				balloon tip) and ComputeStringIndex (if you have				more than the 4 states I provided for.)				Restrictions:	ABalloon is ©1998 by James W. Walker.				Permission is granted for use of ABalloon				free of charge, other than acknowledgement of				James W. Walker in any program using ABalloon				(perhaps in an About box or in accompanying				documentation).		Change history:		1.0  2/28/98		First release.		1.1  4/11/98				• Don’t show balloons for invisible panes				  (Thanks, Daniel Chiaramello, for the correction)				• Rolled ABalloonHelper::CreateABalloonHelper into				  ABalloonHelper::AddABalloon.				• sBalloonAttachments is now a TArray<ABalloon*>				  instead of TArray<LAttachment*>.				• In the HMShowBalloon call, use kHMRegularWindow				  instead of kHMSaveBitsNoWindow, because IM says				  that the former should normally be used.		1.2  6/7/98...6/28/98				• New feature of automatically showing a balloon when				  the cursor is motionless over a pane for a certain				  length of time.  (Thanks to Fabrice for getting me				  started on this and helping to implement it.)				• New subclass that automatically shows a balloon even				  if you have not globally enabled automatic balloons.				• Added pragmas to get rid of annoying TArray warnings.				• Made the TArray an ordinary member rather than a				  static member of ABalloonHelper.				• Changed the balloon mode to kHMSaveBitsWindow to fix				  an update problem when a balloon was removed by the				  appearance of a modal dialog.		1.3  10/3/98, 10/25/98				• New function CalcExposedPortFrame used in FindBalloonPane.				  This is so that a pane inside a scrolling view will				  show its balloon even if it is only partially visible.				  Thanks to Rainer Brockerhoff for reporting this problem.				• Implemented an option to make balloons appear immediately				  when the control key is down.  This was contributed by				  Bill Modesitt.	---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/class ABalloon : public LAttachment{	friend class ABalloonHelper;	public:	enum { class_ID = 'ABal' };						ABalloon(							LStream			*inStream);						virtual			~ABalloon();						bool			GetAutomatic() const { return mAutomatic; }	void			SetAutomatic( bool inAutoMode )						{ mAutomatic = inAutoMode; }		static void		EnableAutoPop( void );	static void		SetAutoPopDelay( UInt32 inDelayTicks );	static void		DisableAutoPop( void );	static void		EnableControlKeyPop( void );	static void		DisableControlKeyPop( void );		static  bool	CalcExposedPortFrame( LPane* inPane, Rect& outFrame );	protected:	virtual void	DoBalloon();		virtual Int16	ComputeStringIndex( LPane* inPane );		virtual void	ShowBalloon( Int16 inStringIndex, Rect& inAltRect );		virtual Point	ComputeTip( const Rect& inAltRect );		ResIDT	mStringListID;	Int16	mOffDisabledIndex;	Int16	mOffEnabledIndex;	Int16	mOnDisabledIndex;	Int16	mOnEnabledIndex;	bool	mAutomatic;		static	LAttachable*	sLastBalloonedItem;	static	Int16			sLastIndex;	static	ResIDT			sLastStringList;};class AAutoBalloon : public ABalloon{public:	enum { class_ID = 'AABa' };						AAutoBalloon( LStream *inStream )						: ABalloon( inStream )						{ mAutomatic = true; }};
